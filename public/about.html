<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Pratham, a third-year engineering student from India with a keen interest in software development and machine learning. 
I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and diving into frontend development to strengthen my technical foundation. 
With a CGPA of around 8, I’m focused on preparing for internships at top product-based companies.
I’ve also recently started my fitness journey, aiming for muscle and weight gain. 
Beyond academics, I’m a cricket lover, a movie enthusiast—especially thrillers—and someone who enjoys expressing creativity through art and meaningful gifts. 
I’m driven, curious, and committed to continuous learning and self-improvement.
